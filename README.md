## Projects

### Current Project (TFT Assistant)

TFT assistant which will help players analyze their game state and offer suggestions on their next move to lead them to victory. 

### 2D Automated Car

Designed and developed a custom 2D simulation environment for an autonomous car, incorporating obstacles, goal-based navigation, and dynamic interactions. Applied a reinforcement learning agent using Deep Q-Network (DQN), optimizing the agent's training with epsilon decay and advanced hyperparameter tuning to improve decision-making performance. Used TensorFlow to design and train neural networks, achieving stable learning and performance improvements, with model checkpoints and evaluation metrics.

### Peony Identification App

Custom-trained a Sequential model to identify peonies specifically compared to other flowers. Collected, cleaned, and labeled thousands of photos of flowers from databases and web browsers for training. Designed and developed a website for image capture and classification with OpenCV and Flask backend for image processing and machine learning algorithm classification.

### Annotation Masking Tool

Utilizing Facebook's SAM2 model I created a masking tool which would highlight entire select areas which would subsequently be used to train future camera tracking algorithms.
